            Do you want to know what set is the best buy?  Has the cheapest price-per-piece?  Can be resold for the highest percentage of its retail price?  Will make the most profit as an investment?
            Dataweapons maintains updated lists of Lego set data, including price-per-piece, part-out-value, and other value metrics.

            I'm working to add more features soon.  For now, enjoy the free data, and stay tuned for updates!
